# Fns-app-v2

FNS is a decentralized name service based on the Filecoin EVM. It resolves Metadata into easy-to-read xxx.fil names. fns.fil subdomains (such as alice.fns.fil) are distinguished from other domains by non-transferable SBT to ensure identity uniqueness. 

We are Filfox team and we devoted ourselves to the development of FVM ecology and won the [Filecoin â€” FEVM Building Blocks](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/fns-filecoin-naming-service-czomc) award with FNS in HACK FEVM. 

During Space Warp, we upgraded the UI/UX of FNS app and contracts and deployed multicall tool contracts on hyperspace. Welcome to try and test our [new app](http://app.filns.domains/)!

Meanwhile, we hope that FNS can be used as a basic tool for the Filecoin ecosystem to help ecological projects provide users with better user experience. Therefore, we integrated FNS in Filfox explorer as [FNS Lookup](https://hyperspace.filfox.info/en/fns) in this hackthon to provide more functions for Filfox explorer users, also provides an example for how to integrate FNS into your own project.
